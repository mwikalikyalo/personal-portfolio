<!--About me-->
  <div class="about">
    <h2 id="me">About me</h2>
    <p>I am a student at Moringa School currently in the Moringa Prep program. I have a background in 
      Psychology. Prior to coming to Moringa School, I was working part-time in The Mater Hospital 
      Comprehensive Care Clinic as a youth counsellor. I decided that I needed a career change during my final year in university and since I already had an interest in 
      the tech industry. My hobbies include reading novels, singing, listening to music and dancing.

        <p class="description">MentalCheck is a collaborative project that was aimed at making therapy 
            accessible. This is done by matching an individual to a therapist who has the 
            credentials and experience to help the individual. The languages used in the 
            project include HTML, CSS and JavaScript.I worked on the form page that contains the form that 
            one answers that connects the individuals to a therapist.</p>
            <button class="project-link"><a href="https://mwikalikyalo.github.io/IP-one/" target="_blank">View Project</a></button>
      <h2 id="photography">MagicPhoto</h2>
      <p class="description">This was the first project I ever did. It was a photography site named MagicPhoto.
          The site showcased a number of phographers' work who do travel photography and share their experiences through photography. 
          The photographs ranged from nature to buildings. The languages used include HTML and CSS.</p>
